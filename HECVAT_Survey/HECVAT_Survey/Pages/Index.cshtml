        What is the HECVAT?
    </b>
    <p>HECVAT or commonly known as the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit is a tool used by higher learning institutions such as
        Colleges and Universities. The HECVAT is designed as a questionnaire framework that has been specifically designed to measure the risk
        for the vendors of these education services. This tool is used to confirm that information, data, and cybersecurity policies are properly in place
        to protect the senstitive information made available to these educational services.

    <b>
        What is the VendorWise?
    </b>
    <p>
        VendorWise is based off the HECVAT infrastructure, converting the original document into a web-based application. This application will take all provided answers and
        securely store them in our database. Any university or higher learning institution that requests this data will be allowed to see and use it.
        Using this platform as advertisement agent for institutions looking for service vendors, our goal is to eliminate long waiting periods and help learning institutions
        find potential service vendor clients.
